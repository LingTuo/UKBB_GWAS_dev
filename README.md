# Pleiotropy Project UKB

## **Goals**

1. **Extension of methods for rare and imputed variants and implementation in SEQSpark**
2. **Detect pleiotropic effects for a variety of diseases and complex traits using rare variant and imputed data**
3. **Determine tissue types most relevant to complex trait/disease etiology**
4. **Analysis of tissue-specific expression levels with phenotype data to biologically validate pleiotropic effects**

The main goal here is to analyze imputed and rare variants for association with different traits (asthma, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, diabetes, waist circumference). First through a single variant analysis using Linear Mixed Models.
